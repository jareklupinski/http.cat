## About

This is the website that is hosted at [https://http.cat](https://http.cat).

The code for the older version hosted at the heroku platform is at the [http-status-cats-api](https://github.com/rogeriopvl/http-status-cats-api) repo.

This version does not need any server side code. The API behavior is provided by a Nginx server config.

The interface is built with React and pre-rendered with react-snap.
